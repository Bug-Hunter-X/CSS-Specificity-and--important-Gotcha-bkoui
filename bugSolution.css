The solution involves restructuring the CSS to avoid unnecessary use of `!important` and leveraging the cascade effectively.

Here's a possible solution:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

/* Alternatively, if the red color needs higher precedence without !important:
.child {
  color: red;
}
.parent .child, .child.special {
  color: green; 
}
*/

```

By carefully managing specificity and avoiding `!important`, the CSS becomes more predictable and maintainable.

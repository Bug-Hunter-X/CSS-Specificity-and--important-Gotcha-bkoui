The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

```

In this case, `.parent .child` has higher specificity than `.child`, overriding the `!important` declaration. However, this behavior might be unexpected for developers unaware of specificity rules.  Another common issue involves using `!important` liberally, which can make CSS difficult to maintain and debug.
